                        Bank," "we," "us,"
                        or "our"), you ("you," "your," the "customer," or "account holder") agree to be bound by these
                        Terms and Conditions, our
                        Privacy Policy, our Online Banking Agreement, our Fee Schedule, and any other applicable
                        agreements (collectively, the
                        "Agreements"). You should read all Agreements carefully.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        2. Definitions
                        "Account" means any deposit, savings, checking, loan, or credit account you have with us.

                        "Business Day" means Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. Transactions and
                        processing may only occur on
                        Business Days.

                        "Online Banking" means our internet-based banking service.

                        "Mobile Banking" means our application-based banking service for mobile devices.

                        "PIN" means Personal Identification Number.

                        "Password" means your secret code for accessing digital services.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        3. Account Opening and Eligibility
                        You must be a legal resident of [Country] and at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority
                        in your state) to open an
                        account individually.

                        To open an account, you must provide valid government-issued identification, taxpayer
                        identification number (e.g., SSN),
                        and other information we require.

                        We may use third-party services to verify your identity and check your history, which may affect
                        our decision to open
                        your account.

                        We reserve the right to decline any application for an account at our sole discretion.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        4. Account Ownership
                        The ownership of your account (e.g., Individual, Joint Tenants, Tenants in Common, Trust,
                        Business) is determined by
                        your application and signature card. The signature card is part of this agreement and controls
                        in case of a conflict
                        with these Terms.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        5. Deposits
                        Funds Availability: Our policy for the availability of deposited funds is detailed in our
                        separate Funds Availability
                        Policy. Generally, some funds from electronic direct deposits and cash deposits are available on
                        the same business day.
                        Checks may be subject to longer holds.

                        Collection of Items: We act as your agent for collecting items (e.g., checks) for deposit. We
                        are not liable for the
                        negligence of another bank. Credit for a deposit is provisional until final settlement is
                        received.

                        Endorsements: You must endorse checks exactly as they are payable. We may accept checks endorsed
                        by stamp or without
                        endorsement if deposited to the named payee's account.

                        Returned Deposits: If a deposited item is returned unpaid, we will debit your account for the
                        amount, plus any
                        associated fee.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        6. Withdrawals and Transfers
                        You may withdraw funds up to the available balance in your account using methods we authorize
                        (e.g., in person, ATM,
                        debit card, electronic transfer).

                        We may refuse a withdrawal if it would overdraw your account, unless you have an overdraft
                        protection plan in place and
                        in use.

                        You agree to the rules and limits for transfers and withdrawals as outlined in our Account
                        Disclosure and Fee Schedule.


                        <br />
                        <br />


                        7. Fees and Charges
                        You agree to pay all fees associated with your accounts as described in our current Fee
                        Schedule.

                        We may change our fees upon providing notice as required by law.

                        We may deduct fees directly from your account balance.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        8. Overdrafts
                        If you do not have sufficient available funds to cover a transaction, we may, at our discretion,
                        pay the item and create
                        an overdraft or return the item unpaid.

                        In either case, you are responsible for any Overdraft Fee or Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) Fee as
                        stated in our Fee
                        Schedule.

                        You may opt-in to a formal Overdraft Protection Plan that links your account to another account
                        or a line of credit.


                        <br />
                        <br />


                        9. Statements
                        Electronic Statements (e-Statements): You consent to receive periodic account statements
                        electronically. You are
                        responsible for accessing and reviewing your statements promptly.

                        Paper Statements: If provided, paper statements will be mailed to the address of record.

                        Reporting Errors: You must examine your statement with reasonable promptness. You must notify us
                        immediately of any
                        errors, forgeries, or unauthorized transactions. Your failure to notify us within 60 days of the
                        statement being made
                        available may limit your rights to dispute the transaction.

                        <br />
                        <br />



                        10. Electronic Banking Services (Online & Mobile)
                        Your use of our Online Banking, Mobile Banking, Bill Pay, and other electronic services is also
                        governed by our separate
                        Online Banking Agreement. You are responsible for the confidentiality of your login credentials,
                        PINs, and Passwords.

                        <br />
                        <br />


                        11. Debit/Credit Cards
                        The use of any debit card, credit card, or ATM card issued by us is subject to the separate
                        Cardholder Agreement
                        provided with the card.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        12. Account Amendments
                        We may change these Terms and Conditions, including fees and service charges, at any time. We
                        will provide you with
                        notice as required by law (typically 30 days in advance). Your continued use of the account
                        after the effective date of
                        the change constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        13. Account Termination
                        By You: You may close your account at any time by requesting closure in writing or in a manner
                        we authorize.

                        By Us: We may close your account or terminate your banking privileges at any time, for any
                        reason (or no reason), with
                        or without prior notice, unless required by law. We will typically mail you a check for the
                        final balance.

                        <br />
                        <br />


                        14. Liability and Limitations
                        Our Liability: We will not be liable for any indirect, special, or consequential damages arising
